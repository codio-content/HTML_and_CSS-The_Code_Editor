We're now going to test your ability to manage files and folders.

|||challenge
Take a look at the folder `04-drag` in the file tree.

1. If you're not sure which file belongs where, open them up and see if it is an image, a text file or an html file.
1. Move each of the files in the `everything` folder into the folder (`html`, `img` or `text`) that best suits its file type.

Don't forget you can move multiple files with one drag operation using the Ctrl key (PC) or Cmd key (Mac) to select before the drag. Was described in the previous section.
