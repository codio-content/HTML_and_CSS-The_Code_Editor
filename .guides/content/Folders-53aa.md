You can think of a *folder* as a filing drawer. It contains one or more files.

To create a new folder

1. Right click on the project and select 'New Folder'.
1. Enter `somefiles` as the folder name. 
1. When naming files and folders, only use letters and numbers and avoid any spaces.
1. Avoid using upper case (capitals) unless you have a good reason, which you don't right now.
1. When you press Enter or the 'OK' button, you should see your new folder in the file tree on the left.
