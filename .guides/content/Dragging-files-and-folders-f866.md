Now we have our folder created, let's move some files into it. The best way to do this is to drag and drop your files. 

1. Click and hold the mouse button on `mary.txt` and drag the mouse onto your new `somefiles` folder.
1. You will see that `mary.txt` has vanished. That's meant to happen.
1. Now click on the `somefiles` folder and there is `mary.txt`. Go ahead and open it.
1. Now move another of the files you created in the last section into `somefiles`.
1. Now move them back to the **root**, which is the lowest level you can put them.
