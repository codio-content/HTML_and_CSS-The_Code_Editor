In the previous challenge we have created two folders and two files. Let's move our files around.

First create one folder called `somefiles` inside `04-drag`.

1. Click and hold the mouse button on `mary1.txt` and drag the mouse onto the other `somefiles` folder.
1. You will see that `mary1.txt` has vanished. That's meant to happen.
1. Now click on the `somefiles` folder and there is `mary1.txt`. Go ahead and open it.
1. Now move `mary2.txt`  into `somefiles`.

## Moving several items at once
You can move more than one file at a time.

1. Click on the first file in the group of files.
1. Now press the Shift key and hold it down
1. Click on the last file. You'll notice that all the files are now selected.
1. Now release the shift key.
1. Click on any of the selected files and drag them into `somefiles`.

## The Ctrl or Cmd key
You can also add or remove individual files to the selected group of files using the Ctrl key (PC) or Cmd key (Mac) before you drag them somewhere.
