Codio has a really nice way of opening files that does not require you to use the file tree.

1. The Open File dialog can be accessed from the 'File' menu at the top.
1. Note the *hotkey* combination that lets you access it from the keyboard without even having to use the mouse. On a PC it is Ctrl + O and on a Mac it is Cmd + O.

When the dialog appears, you can start typing a bit of the file name and you will see the list of files narrowing as you type. You can use the mouse to select a file or the arrow keys. Press Enter once you have highlighted the file you want to open.
